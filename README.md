**GPU-Voxels** is a CUDA based library which allows high resolution volumetric collision detection
between animated 3D models and live pointclouds from 3D sensors of all kinds.
It is mainly developed for robotics planning and monitoring tasks.
See our videos on http://www.gpu-voxels.org/demos/ to get an impression.

## Support:
Find more information on our website http://www.gpu-voxels.org
Doxygen is available at http://www.gpu-voxels.org/doxygen/html/

If you have questions or experience any problems with the software, please post to our GitHub Bugtracker:
at https://github.com/fzi-forschungszentrum-informatik/gpu-voxels/issues

## Install dependencies:
This software is tested under 64 Bit Ubuntu Linux 14.04 and 16.04.
Find detailed installation and linking instructions in our Doxygen.

**Core:**

- CUDA 7.5, 8.0 and 9.1
- PCL
- OpenNI
- Boost
- TinyXML (libtinyxml-dev)

**Visualizer:**

- GLEW (libglew, libglew-dev)
- GLM (libglm-dev). Probably you will have to patch one file: See https://github.com/g-truc/glm/issues/530
- OpenGL
- GLUT (freeglut3, freeglut3-dev)

**Examples:**

- ROS (Robot Operation System)
- OpenNI to interface 3D cameras
- urdfdom
- orocos
- kdl_parser

## Compiling:
        mkdir build
        cd build
        cmake ..
        make

==> This will also generate example programs and a visualization tool to see some live demos.

Doxygen files can be generated by

        make doc

## Enabling C++11
C++11 is not enabled by default. To compile in C++11 mode add this to the top of packages/gpu_voxels/CMakeLists.txt: 
 SET(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

## Known issues
There is a known bug in GLM on Ubuntu 16.04 that has to be patched to allow usage of the visualizer. Apply the patch described at https://github.com/g-truc/glm/issues/530 to /usr/include/glm/detail/func_common.inl
